## Difficulties



Ali took on a lot of tasks this week-- getting the support pages ready is partially dependent on statistics tracking being done, but otherwise they are prepared.



The hardest task may be getting login/signup to work and Joe has been working together with Ali and Rahul on that. It looks like we have the database and input things done, and security is the next monster to tackle.



Seeding databases with our challenges is a SQLite problem that Zay is still working on. Interacting with CSV is the current task, and it’s going well.



  



## Adjustments



Rahul discovered that we can’t use unit tests for the stats on the main screen since they use javascript.



## Lesson



Overall, the project is starting to reform into a multifaceted application with many moving parts. We should focus on getting the different functionality working all together without getting in each other's way.


## New Tasks

Since there is still unfinished business, the tasks will remain intact until the change of power tomorrow at the beginning of class. Rahul's work has shifted to unit testing the text area functionality (seeing that the challenge is being completed as the user populates the area).
