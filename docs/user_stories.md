# User Stories

## Priority Grading
This is a loose system that states a general starting point for the priority of a user story. From that starting point, the priority can change based on what user stories rely on others, whether the function affects the site's basic functionality, and whether the function affects the difficulty of getting other user stories to work.

### Highest(HH)
Gathering a WPM Score (Basic Func of site)

### High(H)
Getting stats from user and others
### Medium(M)
Sources of text
### Low(L)
Connecting different users for SCOREBOARD

## Effort Estimation Grading
6 | More than a week, more than a person

5 | More than a week, one person

4 | One week, one person

3 | Less than a week, one person (Specifically half of a 6)

2 | Less than half of a week, one person

1 | Several Hours or one day, one person

0 | Hour long, one person
