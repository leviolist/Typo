# Typo ¿ Team Contract

The following text outlines the expectations for each member of the group representing the “Typo ¿ Team” or “The Team” while working on the associated group project for the remaining duration of the CS 253 Software Development course at Illinois Wesleyan University. We will be overseen by Mark Liffiton, who will have the final authority on changes and management of the project and the team. 

## The Role of the Leader

The role of Acting Leader of The Team will rotate between the members each week on Tuesday at the beginning of the scheduled class; the rotation will persist in this order: Ali, Joe, Rahul, Zay until either 1) the final day of class or 2) the cession of the project due to completion or dissolution-- whichever occurs first. 

### Acting Leader's Responsibilities 
The Acting Leader assumes responsibility over the Functions of the group. The Functions are as follows:

* The Leader must create and maintain efficient, feasible agendas for Team meetings. 

* The Leader must manage the activities of each meeting and be prepared to schedule private meetings with individual members if needed.

* The Leader should be accessible via the common route of communication in general.

* The Leader is charged with the ability to delegate responsibilities to other members, including themself. 

* The Leader must maintain that each of the individual members are well-informed on the state of The Project, the state of The Team, messages from Mark Liffiton, and any further information that is related to the general function of The Team. 

## The Point of Contact

In general, the primary point of contact between members of The Team is Discord. Other appropriate means of communication include email and Snapchat as needed, but only in the case that Discord is inadequate for any reason. 
Updates to The Project and the state of The Team should be provided through Discord, and it is the responsibility of The Team to be diligent in checking the Discord group chat often for updates. 

## The Structure of Decision-Making

In general, decisions will be made by majority vote. In the case of a tie between two parties, the Leader will flip a coin, with each side favoring one party. If the situation rises that there is a Total Split, or an irreconcilable difference of interest between all parties, the conversation will then include  Mark Liffiton, and decisions will be made in the same manner after further discussion.

## The Rules of Attendance

In general, meetings will take place on Friday each week, from 18:00 CST to 19:30 CST over the Point of Contact. Additional meetings can be scheduled by the Active Leader, with the added benefit of potentially being in-person. Attendance is expected at all scheduled meetings. In the case that some person(s) will not be needed for any part of the meeting, they are expected to inform the Leader of this with good reason in advance, otherwise attendance is expected. In the case that a member will be late or cannot attend, they must notify the Leader at least 8 hours beforehand with good reason in order to be excused. If able, the member who cannot attend should notify the Leader at least 24 hours in advance. 

## The Responsibility  Over Tasks

In general, the responsibility of finishing a specific Task will be delegated to members by the Leader. Each Task will be associated with a User Story from the list of user stories, and it should be completed based on the time estimate assigned to that User Story. In the case of an incomplete Task, the responsibility will be reassigned by the Leader to more members of the Team as needed, potentially overruling the priority of other responsibilities until proper completion. 

## Accountability

Members are expected to follow the above guidelines to the best of their ability. In the case that some member(s) cannot or does not meet some set of responsibilities, the solution will be a cross-communication between said member(s) with all other members, including the Leader. The member(s) who have not met their responsibilities will summarise their situation to the other members and a discussion will ensue, with the goal of creating a solution or plan of action toward a solution. 
In the case that proper communication between all parties does not solve the associated problems, a meeting with Mark Liffiton and the appropriate party must be convened, resulting in a solution or plan of action toward a solution. 

## Team Building

In general, it is good practice for teams to build a relationship outside of work. To that end, the Team should try to eat lunch together on Tuesdays and Thursdays after the end of CS 253 - Software Development class. It is not unacceptable to plan further extracurricular activities with the Team using the Point of Contact.
