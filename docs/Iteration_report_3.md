# Iteration Report / Plan 3

## What each person was responsible for accomplishing.
1. Assigned to Rahul: As a user, I want to view my past challenges (on a personalized dashboard, optional?)
2. Assigned to Isaiah: As an administrator, I want to be recognized as an admin when I log in
3. Assigned to Joe: As a user, I want to log in
4. Assigned to Ali: As an administrator, I want to be able post new challenges for users to play

## What was completed.
1. Backend code for showing attempt info for past attempts.
2. Remade layout
3. a boolean attribute as been added to the Users table denoting whether the user is an admin or not

## What was planned but not finished.
1. Log-in and register functions are still wip
2. Front end design for viewing past attempt info still has to be made
3. Being able to post new challenges

## What troubles/issues/roadblocks/difficulties you encountered.
1. Technical difficulties prevented the completion of the front-end code of showing past attempts
2. There were concerns for how we were going to make new admins and whether they would have to be hard coded or not

## What adjustments to your overall design you discovered.
1. For the admin question, we decided to stay the course and solve any problems that may arise as they come
2. The text selection is finally random now

## One important thing you learned during this iteration.
1. We only met once this week but I feel like if we met more we would've been more productive. We met
on Thusday but in hindsight it would've been better if we also met sometime during the 
weekend

## Plan for next iteration

### Continued work from previous Iterations
1. Continue work on login and register (Joe)
2. Start on front end attempt info work (Rahul)
3. Make a way to put new challengeTexts without having to use console (Ali)
4. Perhaps start or think about storing global highscore stats (Isaiah)

### New user Stories
2. As a User, I want to see my own high score after I complete a challenge so that I can track my peak stats. 
(Ali & Isaiah)
3. As a User, I want to sign into the site so that I can record my specific progress. (Joe & Rahul)

## Plan for next Two Iterations

### Iteration 4
1. As a User, I want to see other users’ overall typing speed so that I can compare my stats & progress to theirs.
2. As a User, I want to see other users’ high scores so that I can compare my stats & progress to theirs.

### Iteration 5
1. As an Administrator, I want to add a challenge database so that my users can access different challenges/text.
2. As a User, I want to export my score data so that I can share it with others.
