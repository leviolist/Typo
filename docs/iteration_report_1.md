# Iteration Report / Plan 1

## Each team members tasks
1.  Ali - Responsible for creating a timer that counts up as soon as a user starts typing the challenge text in a text box
2. Isaiah - Responsible for displaying challenge text on a webpage from the database, dynamically showing how much of the challenge text the user has typed, and making an initial layout for the webpage.
3. Rahul - Setup the database schema and display a text box on the webpage in which the user can type the challenge text
4. Joe - stop the timer and get the end time as soon as the user is done typing the challenge text.

## Work accomplished
1. Created an initial layout for the webpage
2. Setup a database that stores challenge texts
3. Challenge text is displayed on the webpage which is randomly selected from the database each time the page is refreshed
4. Input box is displayed on the webpage where the user can type the challenge text
5. A timer is displayed above the challenge text which starts as soon as the user starts typing in the text input box
6. Added a submit button that resets the timer.

## Work planned but not finished
1. We hoped to track how much of the challenge text had been typed correctly by dynamically changing the color of the challenge text that had been typed. Rahul had started working on this feature, has not been able to finish it.
2. We want the timer to restart as soon as the user finishes typing the text correctly and get tthe end time, but so far the timer only resets with a submit button, so this is also a work in progress. 
3. The plan included adding navigation bars to the initial layout, but we decided that that was not that important of a step right now and we need to focus more on other tasks.

## Troubles/issues/roadblocks/difficulties encountered
1. We were kind of confused on how to get started at the start, but then we figured that out by first creating a simple HTML file for the layout and setup a database to have something to build up from. From there it was easier to start working on our assigned tasks.
2. We were slow in getting a start on our assigned user stories which meant that we didn't have enough time in the end to fix issues, get help from other team members, and finish all the planned user stories.
3. The user stories we weren't able to finish were the more difficult ones and we did estimate that it would take more than a week to finish them, so we are some what satisfied with what we have done so far.

## Adjustments to overall design
1. So far we did not discover any adjustments to our overall design

## Helpful tools
1. Creating issues for each task really helped in dividing and organizing the work

## Plan for next iteration
### Continued work from previous Iterations
1.  As a Typist, I want the application to let me know when I input a character so that I can track where in a sentence I am typing and see what character comes next.**(Assigned to Rahul)**
2. As a Challenger, I want to end the challenge after I've typed all of its content so that the timer does not continue counting down and affecting my typing statistics. **(Assigned to Joe)**

### New user Stories
3. As a Typist, I want to see my typing statistic results after I finish a challenge so that I can gain the benefit of knowing my typing speed and accuracy **(Assigned to Ali)**
4. As a User, I want to see my average WPM and accuracy over multiples runs to have a better understanding of my results and progress. **(Assigned to Isaiah)** 

## Plan for next Two Iterations
### Iteration 3
1. As a Challenger, I want to have a restart button for the challenge so that I can decide when to cut my losses and redo the challenge if/when I make a mistake.
2.  Continued work from User story 4 from previous Iterations.
3. As a User, I want to see my own high score after I complete a challenge so that I can track my peak stats.

###  Iteration 4
1. As a User, I want to register into the site with my personal information so that I can separate my progress from others by signing in.
2. As a User, I want to sign into the site so that I can record my specific progress.
3. As an Administrator, I want to add a challenge database so that my users can access different challenges/text.
4. As an Administrator, I want to be able to sign into the website so that I can access different options from a standard user.
