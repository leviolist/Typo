# Iteration Report / Plan 5

## What each person was responsible for accomplishing.
1. Assigned to Rahul: Unit tests for login and registration
2. Assigned to Isaiah: Pre-seeding the texts database
3. Assigned to Joe: login and registration functionality
4. Assigned to Ali: functionality for user profile page, leaderboard, and adding new text to database as an admin

## What was completed.
1. Pre-seeding of challenge texts database
2. Initial layout page for user profile 
3. Made subtemplates for all HTML pages
4. Increased precision of the timer to fix issue of infinity WPM
5. all user is able to add new challenge text, but that needs to be accessible just for admins which isn't functional yet as login functionality is still a work in progress

## What was planned but not finished.
1. Log-in and register functions are still wip
2. Users profile and leaderboard as it is dependent on login and registration


## What troubles/issues/roadblocks/difficulties you encountered.
1. technical difficulties with login and registration functionality and how to get that working with SQL databases
2. how to trigger a flask route function using java script

## One important thing you learned during this iteration.
1. We definitely need to start reaching out for help from the professor and TA for any technical difficulties earlier rather than just asking questions in class or waiting for thier office hrs.

## Plan for next iteration

1. Right now, the main thing to focus on is getting login and registration wokring, we don't have many other user stories left to implement, but the ones that are left, depend on login functionality. (login and registration is assigned to Rahul and Joe)
2. User profile page and leaderboard functionlaity (assigned to Ali)
3. Viewing past user attempts and their average in a table on the main page (assinged to Isaiah)
